## Theme: 404 not found

## My idea - Brain not found

The control panel for the ship is busted so up and down get swapped to different keys on the keyboard randomly.

Simple tunnel type game aim to move through it without touching the sides. Maybe can increase speed as you progress.

The challenge will be the up and down changing keys all the time. Might be dumb though.
