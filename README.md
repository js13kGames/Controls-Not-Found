# JS 13kb Entry 2020

Entry for [Js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) theme: 404 not found

# Controls NOT FOUND

## My idea - Controls not found

The control panel for the ship is busted so up and down get swapped to different keys on the keyboard randomly.

Simple tunnel type game aim to move through it without touching the sides or rocks in the way. Tunnel gets smaller as you progress.

Not made for mobile, need the keyboard.

Probably many bugs
