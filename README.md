# JS 13kb Entry 2020

# Controls NOT FOUND

## My idea - Controls not found

The control panel of the ship is busted so up and down get swapped to different keys on the keyboard randomly.

A simple tunnel type game where the aim is to move through it without touching the sides or rocks in the way. The tunnel gets smaller as you progress.

Not made for mobile, you need the keyboard.

Keys: Initially use W and S for up and down. As the game progresses, it will change the keys for up and down.

Probably many bugs and it's not very exciting but I got something done, yay!
